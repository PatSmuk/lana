/*
 * Creates a new socket buffer bound to `socket`.
 *
 * All the socket buffer does is allow you to request a certain number of
 *   bytes from the socket, returning a Promise that resolves when enough
 *   bytes have been received to satisfy the request.
 *
 * No requests should be made while another request is pending.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *     // Create a socket buffer bound to some socket.
 *     const socketBuffer = createSocketBuffer(socket);
 *
 *     // Request 16 bytes and write them back to the socket.
 *     socketBuffer.read(16).then((bytes) => {
 *         // It"s safe to call `socketBuffer.read` again in here.
 *         socketBuffer.socket.write(bytes);
 *         socketBuffer.socket.end();
 *     });
 *
 *     // Can't call `socketBuffer.read` here!
 *
 * The underlying socket can be accessed via `SocketBuffer.socket`.
